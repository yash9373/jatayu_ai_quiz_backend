- ✅ Immediate answer feedback and scoring
- ✅ Progress tracking with completion percentages
- ✅ Time tracking per question and overall assessment

### Graph Integration Hints

The implementation provides comprehensive hints for integrating with your MCQ generation graphs:

1. **Graph Initialization**:

   ```python
   # Initialize with test's skill graph and job description
   await assessment_graph_service.initialize_assessment_graph(
       connection_id, test, user_id, db
   )
   ```

2. **Question Generation**:

   ```python
   # Uses existing graph.ask_question() method
   question_data = await assessment_graph_service.generate_question(connection_id)
   ```

3. **Answer Processing**:
   ```python
   # Updates graph state with responses
   feedback_data = await assessment_graph_service.process_answer(
       connection_id, question_id, selected_option
   )
   ```

### Test Scheduler Integration

The system includes TODO markers for test scheduler validation:

- ✅ **Test timing validation** (start time, deadlines)
- ✅ **Duration compliance checks**
- 📝 **TODO**: Detailed test window validation
- 📝 **TODO**: Maximum attempt tracking
- 📝 **TODO**: Candidate eligibility verification

## 📋 TODO Items for Implementation

### High Priority

1. **Test Scheduler Integration**

   ```python
   # TODO: Implement comprehensive test scheduler validation
   # - Check test duration limits
   # - Validate assessment windows
   # - Track maximum attempts per candidate
   # - Ensure compliance with test deadlines
   ```

2. **Database Persistence**

   ```python
   # TODO: Save assessment results to database
   # - Create assessment result tables
   # - Store question-wise responses
   # - Update candidate application status
   # - Generate assessment reports
   ```

3. **Graph State Persistence**
   ```python
   # TODO: Persist graph state for recovery
   # - Handle connection drops during assessment
   # - Resume assessments from last saved state
   # - Implement checkpointing for long assessments
   ```

### Medium Priority

4. **Enhanced Error Recovery**

   - Connection drop recovery
   - Assessment state restoration
   - Network failure handling

5. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Real-time assessment analytics
   - Performance monitoring
   - Connection metrics tracking

## 🔄 Message Flow Example

```
Client                          Server
  |                              |
  |------- Connect with JWT ---->|
  |<---- auth_success ------------|
  |                              |
  |--- start_assessment -------->|
  |<-- assessment_started -------|
  |<-- question (auto) ----------|
  |                              |
  |--- submit_answer ----------->|
  |<-- answer_feedback ----------|
  |<-- progress_update ----------|
  |<-- question (next) ----------|
  |                              |
  |        ... repeat ...        |
  |                              |
  |<-- assessment_completed -----|
  |                              |
```

## 🧪 Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive test client (`websocket_test_client.py`) that demonstrates:

- Connection establishment and authentication
- Full assessment flow simulation
- Message handling and protocol compliance
- Error scenarios and recovery

### Running Tests

```bash
# 1. Start the server
uvicorn main:app --reload

# 2. Get a JWT token (login via API)
# 3. Update token in test client
# 4. Run test client
python websocket_test_client.py
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Scalability

- Connection pooling ready
- Shared state preparation for horizontal scaling
- Efficient memory management with cleanup
- Background task optimization

### Optimization

- Lazy loading of graph components
- Efficient message serialization
- Connection state caching
- Resource cleanup automation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Dependencies

The WebSocket system uses FastAPI's built-in WebSocket support. No additional dependencies required beyond what's already in your project.

### 2. Configuration

Update your environment variables if needed:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

### 3. Testing

1. Start your FastAPI server
2. Connect using the test client or any WebSocket client
3. Use a valid JWT token for authentication

### 4. Frontend Integration

Your React frontend can connect using the WebSocket API:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(
  `ws://localhost:8000/ws/assessment?token=${jwtToken}&test_id=${testId}`
);
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Complete the TODO items** marked in the code for full functionality
2. **Test the integration** with your existing MCQ generation system
3. **Implement database persistence** for assessment results
4. **Add comprehensive test scheduler validation**
5. **Deploy and test** in your production environment

The WebSocket implementation provides a solid foundation for your AI assessment chatbot with room for extension and customization based on your specific requirements.
